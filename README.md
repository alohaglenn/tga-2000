## Quote from You ##

"For years, I've had to find sound effects for my DJ sets and for music production. Often times, I'd spend hours digging through thousands of sound effects on vinyl or on YouTube just to find the right air horn or siren for a song I was working on. The TGA-2000 eliminates that altogether and offers a wide range of built-in sounds so that users can just focus on creating the music that will change the world." - Glenn Gonda, CEO


## How to Get Started ##

Simply just click on a square pad. Repeat.


## Customer Quote ##

"Thanks to the TGA-2000, I have one place I can go when I need a sound effect for my DJ set. I used to waste time going through the thousands of samples in sound libraries, and sometimes walk away empty-handed. The TGA-2000 saves me time since I know I can just open it during one of my sets." - Skrillex, DJ
